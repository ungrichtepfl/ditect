# Neural Networks

## Percept roes

- One of the first artificial neurons
- binary inputs, 1 binary output
- using weighted sum and threshold
- Easy to implemented NAND gate

## Sigmoid neurons

- Contrary to _Perceptrons_ small changes in their weights and bias cause only
  a _small_ change in output: $\sigma \eq \div{1}{1+\exp{-z}}$
-
